    "赫克托尔决心等待阿喀琉斯；他把盾牌靠在塔的窗台上，等待他的医生。赫克托尔无法避免与阿喀琉斯的战斗。普里阿摩斯的儿子担心特洛伊人会指责他依靠他的力量摧毁了特洛伊。毕竟，我建议他波利达曼特在阿基里斯参战之前到特洛伊的军队避难。现在，赫克托耳还剩下一件事——与阿喀琉斯交战，要么赢，要么死。赫克托尔也有这样的想法：不带武器去见阿喀琉斯，答应他归还美丽的埃琳娜和所有从墨涅拉俄斯，并与他们一起献出伟大特洛伊所有财富的一半。赫克托尔立即拒绝了这个想法。他知道阿喀琉斯不会和他达成协议，他会手无寸铁地杀死他，就像一个无能为力的女人。\n",
    "阿喀琉斯越来越近了。恐惧抓住了赫克托，他从特洛伊周围的强大儿子 Pelea 身边跑开。在他的身后，风雨如磐的阿喀琉斯，就像鹰追虚弱的鸽子一样。英雄们绕着特洛伊转了三圈。\n",
